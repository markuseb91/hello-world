Relearning GitHub


This is nuts.  I used this back in 2012, maybe even 2011(?) I think it was 2012 when I made the move to InsiderPages.  And the last time I used it in earnest was in 2014 with MGo.  Then came SYmantec... 

Back to dusty old tech like P4 and my Git sucks.  So relearn before I break something
